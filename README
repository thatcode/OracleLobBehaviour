This is a behaviour to fix CakePHP's handling of BLOB fields with an Oracle Database.

Outline of how it works:

In model.php:
    var $actsAs = array('OracleBlob' => array('blob_field1', 'blob_field2'));

On a call to save or find:
The behaviour checks the fields being saved or found for the fields specified above. If any are found they are removed and stored internally. On a save call, $Model->processData($fieldName, $data) is called to allow further processing. After the main call further calls are done to find/save the BLOBs.

Upgrades to do:
Let the Behaviour automatically determine BLOB fields.
Also cope with CLOB and LOB fields (Will be coupled with a slightly re-written datasource).
Finally - rewrite the datasource to cope with BLOB, CLOB and LOB fields, making this behaviour obsolete.
